## Introduction

This project applies deep neural networks to predict crop yield based on various field, soil, and environmental measurements. The goal is to demonstrate how Deep Learning can handle data complexity and improve decision-making in agriculture.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, we recommend using the specified package versions to ensure reproducibility of the results.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have the following key package versions:

- Python 3.11.5
- TensorFlow 2.16.1
- scikit-learn 1.4.2
- pandas 2.2.2
- joblib 1.4.2

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the experiment:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Deep_Learning_Project.ipynb
   ```

## Model and Training

The model was built using TensorFlow and consists of a sequential neural network with dense and dropout layers. Training uses the Adam optimizer with EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to manage the learning process.

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
```

## Results

The model was evaluated based on error metrics (MSE and MAE), demonstrating the ability of Deep Learning to capture complex patterns in crop data and improve prediction accuracy.

- **Test Loss (MSE):** 153
- **Test MAE:** 10
