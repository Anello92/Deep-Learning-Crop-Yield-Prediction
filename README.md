Deep Learning for Crop Yield Prediction and Irrigation Optimization

This repository contains the code and dataset for a project focused on crop yield prediction and irrigation optimization using Deep Learning techniques. The approach demonstrates how neural networks can effectively handle multivariate analysis, especially in complex datasets.

Project Overview

The project aims to predict crop yield and optimize irrigation using a Deep Learning model. This solution leverages historical data on various factors such as soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop health indicators to make accurate predictions.
